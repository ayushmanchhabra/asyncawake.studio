The house (application) is not gated. Everyone can see who is entering/exiting and infer the overall activity in the house (HTTP).

The house now has walls. No one from the _outside_ can see the activity going on. If the thief manages to get inside, they can see all the activity (network sniffer/interceptor tool).

Every person (user) going in rings the bell (authentication). The people inside verify their identify and allow them entry (authorization).

Only the owner and affiliated people (family/rentors/friends) have the house keys (admin account).

From the thousands of houses, the thief (hacker) identifies which house to break into. Their goal is to break in by any means necessary - be it by stealing the house keys, climbing over/breaking the wall or breaking/opening a window that was accidently left unlocked (vulnerbilities). Breaking in (exploit) leads to heavy physical and monetary damage.

To prevent potential break ins, it is necessary to address issues inside the house as they come and renovate (cyber security audit) as necessary (every month, quartely, yearly). Otherwise, over time it will deteriorate from the inside making it easier for robberies to happen.
