You [get new ideas](https://paulgraham.com/getideas.html) by noticing them. You notice them by having an open mindset and positive attitude. Changing your mindset starts with the brain. You can change how your brain thinks by consuming the write content and talking to the right people. Wander around, build prototypes and find product market fit.

Executiion

[Execution is a muscle that you have to train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CDBbEVBtBU). Choose a work stack that allows you to go super fast and keep building projects that are scoped with ideally 1, but maximum of 3 features. If a product/service does too many things, it loses its identify and hence its brand value.

Launch

Find platforms which have pre-existing tech communities such as Twitter, Hacker News, Reddit and Product Hunt. Build in public - once you're done, demo the project via a YouTube video. Ask and be open to feedback.
