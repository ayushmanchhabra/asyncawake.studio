It has been one year since I started in cyber security, here are [some things]((https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security)) I wish I knew beforehand.

Programming: Learn one coding language really well and build something meaningful with it. Learn [common software engineering concepts](https://12factor.net) such as Git, DevOps, etc.

Cyber Security: Familiarise yourself with CIA concepts, threat modelling, OSI model, application and network architecture. Practice hacking skills via [Portswigger Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs), [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/), CTFs and bug bounty programs.

Time Management: Be punctual every single day. This means reach 10-15 minutes before office starts. Prioritise your sleep, food and exercise over everything and everyone.

Project Management: Be consistent in your work, behaviour and communication and always try to improve every day. Take ownership of tasks assigned and be ethical. Identify things that can be improved (processes, penetration testing methodologies, etc) and work on it.

Career Growth: Do one certificate for the resume ([CEH](https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) or [ISO LA](https://pecb.com/en/education-and-certification-for-individuals/iso-iec-27001/iso-iec-27001-lead-auditor)) and the subsequent ones for learning. Setup home labs

Portfolio: Every month try to learn something new. This could be a framework, vulnerability, programming language or security tool.
