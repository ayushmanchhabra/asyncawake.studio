It has been one year since I started in cyber security, here are [some things]((https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security)) I wish I knew beforehand.

> Please keep in mind that a career in cyber security

Programming: Learn one coding language really well and build something meaningful with it. Learn [common software engineering concepts](https://12factor.net) such as Git, DevOps, etc.

Cyber Security: Familiarise yourself with CIA concepts, threat modelling, OSI model, application and network architecture. Practice hacking skills via [Portswigger Labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs), [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com/) and other CTFs.

Time Management: Be punctual every single day. This means reach 10-15 minutes before office starts. Prioritise your sleep, food and exercise over everything and everyone. Be consistent in your work, behaviour and communication and always try to improve every day. Take ownership of tasks assigned and be ethical. Identify things that can be improved (processes, penetration testing methodologies, etc) and work on it.

Certificates: [eJPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/) is practical heavy. [Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) is theory heavy. [CEH](https://www.eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) is theory heavy with some practical. OSCP is balanced but is expensive. The recommendaton is to do eJPT then start preparing for OSCP.

General: Update resume and portfolio on ad hoc basis (for example, finished a project or completed a certification). This way your profile is always up to date.
